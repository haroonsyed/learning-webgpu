# Learning WebGPU

Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTFFdZSDiTU and https://webgpufundamentals.org/

I already have experience with opengl, cuda. I want to start learning more about webassembly and webgpu so I can run these applications cross platform.
I have a couple projects in mind to do with these technologies, but I'm going to follow a tutorial till I get bored to get the basics down first.

## Getting Started

1. You're going to need nodejs
2. Most updated browsers now support webgpu
3. Run `npm run build` and then open `dist/index.html` in the browser
